# aspnet-mvc-interfaceviewmodel
I created this repository to show the differences between the two frameworks when rendering an interface ViewModel.
## Getting started
You can run the two projects as they are or edit the ViewModel as shown in the Index action method inside Home controller.
As you can see when you run the two applications, the ViewModel gets correctly rendered only on the ASP.NET MVC 5 project. 

I think this might be a bug in ASP.NET Core.
